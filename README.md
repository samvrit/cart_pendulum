# Cart and Pendulum

This is a classic cart and pendulum controls problem. It uses the linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) method for control. This has a C-implementation for the Kalman filter for a discrete time state space system, and custom matrix manipulation functions. A Simulink model with a software-in-the-loop block is also included.
